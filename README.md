# Speaker stay-awake
HTML audio player and sound file that will stop your studio monitors from turning off!

I recently started a new job where they already had a pair of KRK Rokit 6's in the studio and the auto off feature drives me absolutely INSANE. Basically, if the speakers don't see any signal for 30 minutes they turn off - no problem, except they take ages to turn on again and I have to feed them a loud signal to get them to wake up - GRRR.

So, to get around this I have made a 10hz tone wave file and a simple HTML audio player to play the file. The page auto-refreshes every 25 minutes so the speakers never turn off - you can't hear the 10hz tone and it's signal is enough to keep the speakers on.

I just have this site open in my browser in a tab all day and forget about it.
